You can see, detecting whether a string is normalized can be quite efficient. A lot of the cost of normalizing in the.Econd row ‚Äù is for the initialization of buffers. The cost of which is amortized when one is processing larger strings.It turns out, these buffers are rarely needed, so we may change the implementation at some point to speed up the.Mon case for small strings even further.
